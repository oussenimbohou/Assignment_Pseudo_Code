Exercice 1: Write pseudo code that reads two numbers and multiplies them together and print out their product. 
		
FUNCTION [Quotient of 2 numbers]
	BEGIN
	DECLARE 3 VARIABLES: firstNumber AS NUMBER AND secondNumber AS NUMBER
					quotient AS Number 
	READ firstNumber AND secondNumber
	quotient = firstNumber * secondNumber
	OUTPUT quotient
END END FUNCTION

Exercice 2: Write pseudo code that tells a user that the number they entered is not a 5 or a 6. 
FUNCTION [Is_Not_5_Is_Not_6]
	BEGIN
	DECLARE VARIABLE num AS NUMBER
	READ num
	IF(num NOT 5) THEN:
		OUTPUT("The entered number is not a 5")
	END IF
	IF(num not 6) THEN:
		OUTPUT("The entered number is not 6")
	END IF
	OUTPUT(num)
END FUNCTION

Exercice 3: Write pseudo code that performs the following: Ask a user to enter a number. If the number is between 0 and 10, write the word blue. If the number is between 10 and 20, write the word red. if the number is between 20 and 30, write the word green. If it is any other number, write that it is not a correct color option. 

FUNCTION [Number_To_Color]
	BEGIN
	DECLARE VARIABLE num AS NUMBER
	IF(num  >  0 AND  num  < 10 ) THEN
		OUTPUT("blue")
	END IF
	IF(num > 10 AND num < 20) THEN:
		OUTPUT("red")
	END IF
	IF(num > 20 AND num < 30) THEN:
		OUTPUT("green")
	END IF
	OUTPUT("That"s not a correct color option")
END FUNCTION

Exercice 4: Write pseudo code to print all multiples of 5 between 1 and 100 (including both 1 and 100). 

FUNCTION [Multiple_of_5]
BEGIN
	DECLARE VARIABLE counter AS NUMBER
	INITIALIZE counter = 5
	REPEAT UNTIL counter <= 100 
		IF(counter MOD 5 IS 0) THEN:
			OUTPUT(counter)
			count = count + 1
		END IF
	END LOOP
END FUNCTION

Exercice 5: Write pseudo code that will count all the even numbers up to a user defined stopping point. 

FUNCTION [Even_Numbers]
	BEGIN
	DECLARE VARIABLE num AS NUMBER, counter AS NUMBER
	READ num
	REPEAT UNTIL counter <= num
		IF(num MOD 2 IS 0) THEN
			counter = counter + 1
		END IF
	END LOOP
END FUNCTION
		
Exercice 6: Write pseudo code that will perform the following.   
a)	Read in 5 separate numbers.  
b)	Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c)	Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.  
d)	Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are 

FUNCTION [min_max]
	BEGIN
	DECLARE VARIABLES a,b,c,d,e AS NUMBER,average AS NUMBER,min AS NUMBER,max AS NUMBER
	INITIALIZE min = a,max = a
	READ a,b,c,d,e
	average = (a+b+c+d+e)/5
	IF(min > b) THEN:
		min = b
	END IF
	IF(min > c) THEN:
		min = c
	END IF
	IF(min > d) THEN:
		min = d
	END IF
	IF(min > e) THEN:
		min = e
	END IF
	IF(max < b) THEN:
		max = b
	END IF
	IF(max < c) THEN:
		min = c
	END IF
	IF(max < d) THEN:
		min = d
	END IF
	IF(max <e) THEN:
		min = e
	END IF
	OUTPUT(min)
	OUTPUT(" is a minimum value")
	OUTPUT(max)
	OUTPUT(" is a maximum value")
END FUNCTION

Homework 1: Write pseudo code that reads in three numbers and writes them all in sorted order. 
Solution 1
FUNCTION [Three_Sorted_Numbers]
	BEGIN
	DECLARATION VARIABLES a,b,c AS NUMBER
	READ a,b,c
	IF(a<b<c) THEN:
		OUTPUT(a,b,c)
	END IF
	ELSE IF(a<c<b) THEN:
		OUTPUT(a,c,b)
	END IF
	ELSE IF(b<a<c) THEN:
		OUTPUT(b,a,c)
	END IF
	ELSE IF(b<c<a) THEN:
		OUTPUT(b,c,a)
	END IF
	ELSE IF(c<a<b) THEN:
		OUTPUT(c,a,b)
	END IF
	ELSE IF(c<b<a) THEN:
		OUTPUT(c,b,a)
	END IF
END FUNCTION

Solution 2
FUNCTION [Three_Sorted_Numbers]
	BEGIN
	DECLARATION VARIABLES a,b,c AS NUMBER
	READ a,b,c
	IF(a>b) THEN:
		swap(a,b)
	END IF
	IF(a>c) THEN:
		swap(a,c)
	END IF
	IF(b>c) THEN:
	swap(b,c)
	END IF
	OUTPUT(a,b,c)
END FUNCTION
Homework 2: Write pseudo code that will calculate a running sum. A user will enter numbers that will be added to the sum and when a negative number is encountered, stop adding numbers and write out the final result.
FUNCTION [Running_Sum]
	BEGIN
	DECLARE VARIABLE num,sum AS NUMBER
	INITIALIZE sum = 0
	REPEAT UNTIL num < 0
		READ num
		sum = sum + num
	END LOOP
	OUTPUT(sum)
END FUNCTION
